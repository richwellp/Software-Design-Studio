# 2D Physics Collisions

## Author: [Richwell Perez]

---

I want to simulate 2D physics inelastic and elastic collisions that includes gravity. The background knowledge I have for this project is a basic   understanding of classical physics. I want to do this project because it will help me and my friends that I teach to visualize and better understand classical physics collisions.  
I will use Cinder for UI designing. I intend to use [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) as my external library. I will primarily use it for math and physics functions dealing with angles, vectors, et cetera.  
By the end of Week 1, I expect my project to have implemented the UI. By the end of Week 2, my project would have functioned properly in inelastic collisions. By the end of Week 3, I expect my project to simulate both types of collisions. If I finished the   project early, I will try to add more complexity in my calculations, such as inclined planes.
